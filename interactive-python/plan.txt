Web panel located at danieljon.es/beambot
	using apache auth (?)
	Using token auth emailed to me (?)
	Web panel features:
		Blog/website theme (?)
		Send messages
		Edit user command list
		Join channels
		Part channels
		Restart bot
		Change nickname
		
Python bot
	Rewrite bot/reuse components
	Use threading
		Webserver thread (?)
		Send/receive data thread
		Bot thread

Idea for web interface:
website with a form -> use javascript to send post requests without leaving page
seperate python script running using cgi to get post data -> connect to beambot with a socket
beambot receives input from cgi script -> do what is requested -> send a response back (?)
